Dr. Sue Johnson speaks so delightfully about relationships, communication,
and focusing on each other. As a therapist, she has extensive experience
with broken relationships of all sorts. I just love her observations about
little ways we connect with each other (or don't) and how connection (or
lack thereof) can lead to immense changes in one's life. This is one to
revisit periodically.
