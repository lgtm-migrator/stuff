This documentary, on YouTube in 3 parts, chronicles the creation and fall
of Kodak, a company founded in my hometown of Rochester, NY. In the last
few years, it filed for bankrupty, not delivering a high-quality, low-cost
digital camera as the market began demanding it.

The history as told by this documentary details the obsessive drive of
George Eastman to create the next big innovation in photography. It reminds
me of the most iconic obsessive, detail-oriented co-founder in modern
history, Steve Jobs of Apple Computer.

I recently acquired a film camera and have loved shooting film, mostly
Kodak-made (some Fujifilm). It's interesting to dig into the past of a
company so central to the life of Rochestarians. You can watch them all here:
