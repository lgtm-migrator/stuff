I am crazy-impressed by the amazing product [Kyle Bragger][] and [Luke Beard][]
(of [Elepath][]) have put out recently, called [Exposure][]. It offers a new
means of telling a story with photos in a beautiful, unique way. I'm impressed
so far and hope I'm let into the beta soon. Sign up for the waiting list and be
wow'd yourself by this amazing new service.
