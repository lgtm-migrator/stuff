Suzanne Simard explains some fantastic research about how trees pass
information to one another. Through their roots and a symbiotic fungal
network, trees pass chemical messages to each other. Simard notes how
forests, through massive long-distance networks of trees, can behave as a
single organism. Fascinating research, expertly delivered.
