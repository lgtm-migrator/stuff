Talking about the Attica Rebellion, Cornel West, a Princeton Professor,
describes exactly what has happenend to the American Psyche since September 11,
2001:

> Forty years later we come back to commemorate this struggle against the
> historical backdrop of a people who have been so terrorized and traumatized
> and stigmatized that we have been taught to be scared, intimidated, always
> afraid, distrustful of one another, and disrespectful of one another, but the
> Attica Rebellion was a counter-move in that direction.

He continues...

> I call it the "Niggerization of a People," not just Black people, because
> America has been niggerized since nine-eleven. When you're niggerized, you're
> unsafe, unprotected, subject to random violence, hated for who you are, you
> become so scared that you defer to the Powers That Be, and you're willing to
> consent to your own domination.

Nothing has ever explained the attitude of Americans since 9/11 as clearly as
this.
