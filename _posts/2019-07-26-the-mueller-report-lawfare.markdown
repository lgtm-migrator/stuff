[Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com), a publication primarily focused on
legal analysis of foreign policy & national security, has started a podcast
called "The Report," which tells the story of the Mueller Report.

After listening to just two episodes, I'm absolutely hooked. The discussion
of this report is often aimed towards misconduct of a particular candidate
and their campaign staff, but it misses the point. The Mueller Report tells
a story of the massive disinformation campaign that the Russian Federation
and its affiliates are waging against United States citizens everyday.

I am grateful to Lawfare for producing such a wonderful, compelling
analysis of a complex report for the masses.

The [first episode is called "Active Measures"](https://overcast.fm/+TGgVDlzXg)
and tells the detailed story of the disinformation campaign. The [second
episode is called "Hack. Dump. Divide."](https://overcast.fm/+TGgWtvapk)
and it tells the story of the email hacking and the massive document dumps.

This podcast is well worth your time.
