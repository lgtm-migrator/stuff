Frances Frei is such an interesting person. She went into Uber to help
transform that organization after its massive scandal, and she more
recently worked at WeWork helping transform this organization too. She's a
professor at Harvard Business School, and has such a unique view on making
change in businesses in crisis.

Wonderful stories from her work, and such a brilliant mind.
