Long have I been searching for a highly technical podcast that covers a lot
of ground. I recently stumbled upon Lex Fridman’s podcast "Artificial
Intelligence" on YouTube and have decided to subscribe. The initial videos
I saw were
[discussion with David Patterson on RISC vs CISC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNgdcn4Ux1k&t=490s)
and described
[how hardware has evolved over time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHVPU2x3Rjk)
to meet its challenges.
I found their conversation very engaging and went to search for more.

Upon subscribing, I looked at the back catalog of episodes and immediately
downloaded this interview with Brian Kernighan, a Bell Labs alumnus and
author of many famous programming books. I really enjoyed listening to
stories about the foundations of computer programming as a discipline and
how Bell Labs helped to shape the future through UNIX, C, and many other
contributions. I would highly recommend this podcast even if you don’t care
for AI/ML topics, as there’s a lot of other conversation to be enjoyed.
