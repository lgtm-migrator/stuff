Tim opens his TED Talk with a personal story that helps frame his context:
on the brink of suicide, he decided he needed a way to manage his ups and
downs. Tim has bipolar depression and was not coping well with it. He goes
on to describe his discovery of [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).

This is part of his recipe for "avoiding self-destruction." He describes
stoicism as "an operating system for thriving in high-stress environments."
While Stoicism encompasses a far-ranging philosophy for living one's life,
Tim hones in one just one tenet: training yourself to separate what you
can control from what you cannot control. Through exercises, one can use
this to decrease "emotional reactivity."

Ferriss finds from this a tool Stoics like Seneca use in their practice:
_premeditatio malorum_, or the premeditation of evils. This simply means
visualizing the worst-case scenarios one fears which are preventing one
from taking action in order to aid one in taking the action being
prevented. His written exercise is fear-setting, which he does each quarter.

1. Finish this sentence: "What if I...?" Define an action that you don't want to take.
2. List the fears you have. You want 10-20.
3. For each fear, list how you can prevent the fear, or decrease the
   likelihood of it happening.
4. For each fear, what could you do to repair the situation if the fear
   came true? Could you ask someone to help?
5. Then ask yourself: What might be the benfits of an attempt or partial success?
6. Now consider the cost of _inaction_, emotionally, physically, financially, etc.
7. List what your life would look like in 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years if
   you took no action.

This is exactly how my brain works: I immediately think of the worst-case
scenario and overwhelm myself with possibilities until I'm stuck. It often
means I can only take small, incremental actions until I assuage my fears.
Working through a more wholistic fear-setting exercise for big decisions
and bigger actions seems like a good step forward.
