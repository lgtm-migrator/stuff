Tony Lyon presented at SRECon 2017 and talked about distributed teams.

Holy shit yes, this is all so relevant to my daily life working in a vastly
distributed company. Tony approaches the topic from his experience working
at Facebook (and previous gigs) as a manager of distributed teams.
Communication is absolutely crcuial and Tony does a wonderful job of
explaining the nuances behind running successful distributed teams.
