An episode of Slate's _Amicus_ podcast in which Dahlia Lithwick interviews
the Reverend William Barber. She asks a very poignant question and receives
an even more poignant response from the Rev. about being tired. I'll let
them finish:

> **DAHLIA:** Reverend Barber I have one last question, and I think I want to
> ask it because I get so much mail from people who say, "I'm tired. I'm
> tired of the tweets. I'm tired of the lying. I'm tired of my job being to
> track all of this craziness and I think we're losing." You have just
> relaunched, as you said, Dr. King's "Poor People's Campaign", folks are
> getting arrested on the streets again. What do you tell our listeners who
> are just beginning to think the rule of law has slipped away and that we
> are on some kind of 24-hour crazy reality show of lawless norm-erosion,
> and they don't know what to do. What do you tell them? What's the answer?
> How do you both keep aware of what's going on and be educated and
> engaged, but also keep your sanity when it feels as though this program
> may never, ever end?
>
> **REV. BARBER:** Well I would tell them first of all to go to
> [www.breachrepairers.org][] and look at some of the testimonies of the
> people who are fighting back. Or to the [www.poorpeoplescampaign.org][],
> people who are fighting back.
>
> And I would say, before you want to quit, talk to the sister I met in
> Washington State who lived in a homeless camp in Grays Harbor who came to
> a mass meeting and said, **"I am the white trash that America threw out but
> forgot to burn, I'm joining the Poor People's Campaign."**
>
> Or go with me to the two coal miners in Harlan, Kentucky, one black and
> one white, who told me the real story about what has happened to them,
> and how the union was undermined, and talk to them about why they're
> joining the Poor People's Campaign &mdash; one with black lung and says
> because of that, that's the reason he can never stop fighting against
> racism and against those that would block healthcare.
>
> Or meet Callie Greer from Alabama whose daughter died in her arms because
> the Alabama governor and legislature refused to expand medicaid. She's on
> the front lines saying, **"We have to turn our pain into power. We have
> to cry until we are heard."**
>
> Or go and meet another lady I met who was jipped by predatory lenders in
> the South, forced to pay $120,000 for a single-wide trailer that is
> now falling apart and full of mold. Her child, and 11-year-old, has now
> developed breathing disorders from the mold and has to wear a CPAP
> machine. She herself is disabled. But she said, "I want you to come in my
> house and show America what poor people are going through, and I'm
> willing to join [the Poor People's Campagin] and to fight back."
>
> Or meet the lady down in El Paso, the mother who had not seen her
> husband and children for 16 years. She fought with Border Control until
> she finally said to them, "Where is it that I can go and at least
> touch my husband without it being illegal?" And they said, "If you walk
> into the middle of the Rio Grande river from the United States side, and
> he walks from the Mexico side, we'll give you three minutes in the middle
> of the river." She led us into the river with garbage bags on our legs.
> We walked in there; we touched her husband and children she hadn't
> seen 16 years. She's organizing and committed.
>
> I would first say you need to focus on the faces of the people who have
> not had to fight over the last year, but have had to fight a long time,
> communities which look like the Civil Rights movement never happened, the
> War on Poverty never happened.
>
> Secondly, I would say you need to focus on the history that has brought
> us here. Sometimes you're in a moment and you forget the moment's behind
> you. Tired? What about the slaves that battled for 250 years. What about
> the abolitionists who were locked up, like William Llyod Garrison who was
> locked up in Boston for preaching the damnable gospel that all people are
> equal. Or Thoreau, who when he was asked if he would repent for his civil
> disobedience, he said, "The only thing I will repent of is for not asking
> sooner what devil possessed me so long to be quiet so long." Think about
> the people who fought against lynching. Ida B. Wells oftentimes went and
> challenged lynchings with only 8 people. Remember that the Selma marchers
> and the civil rights movement didn't start with a half a million people,
> but 50 people sometimes, 40 people sometimes. **We have to focus on the
> history of the past in order to face the moment of the present.**
>
> And then lastly, for me, as a person of faith, I have to go deep into my
> faith that says the time to have moral dissent and moral action and moral
> activism is when the moments are the roughest. It is when it looks like
> the odds are against you that you have to stand up and speak out. We are
> in a moment of necessity, a moment that says &mdash; there's a scripture
> that Dr. King used to use, Hebrews chapter 10, that says "We are not of
> those who shrink back unto destruction, but we are those who persevere
> under the salvation of the soul, for faith is the substance of things
> hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
>
> I would say how can we *not* keep fighting, particularly when those who
> fought and won in the past, they had less than we have now. They didn't
> have the radio station. They didn't have the twitter, the email. They
> didn't have the cell phones. They didn't have the education. But they
> fought.
>
> I was reading last night about [Mr. Spies][] who was hung for fighting
> for an 8-hour work day in the 1800's. He said when he was being hung,
> "You might try to put this out today, but there is a fire underneath.
> There is a subterranean fire of resistance that is bubbling up."
>
> My answer to people would be if we claim to be the children of Martin and
> Dorothy Day and Lerida Mart and all of the great freedom fighters, if we
> are their descendants, then **standing down is not an option. We lose
> only when we get quiet. We lose only when we stop fighting. We must
> declare that somebody's hurting the people and we will not be silent
> anymore.** And that is why the time to be a movement is when a movements
> are necessary. And indeed moral movements &mdash; anti-racist,
> anti-poverty &mdash; deeply moral, deeply transformative moral movements
> are necessary right now, and there's nobody else that's gonna do it. All
> of our heroes are not getting up out of the grave, but they are cheering
> us from the balconies of Heaven, I believe, and saying it's time for us
> to do our part.
>
> I would rather die having tried and seen nothing change, than to live,
> not try, and see nothing change. The reality is this is the time we have
> to get a second wind, we have to gird up our strength, and we have to
> remember by focusing on the faces of today that are fighting, focusing on
> the histories and the battles of the past when people fought, and
> whatever gives you faith, it's time to gird it up. Not for the Democratic
> Party, not for the Republican Party, but for the salvation and the soul
> of this democracy.
