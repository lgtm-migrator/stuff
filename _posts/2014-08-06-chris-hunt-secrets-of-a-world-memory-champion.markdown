Chris Hunt gave a brilliant talk on memory and how we can improve ours.
It's a long talk, but it's well worth it. Key take-aways:

- Create a spatial memory from a non-spatial one
- Make the memories surprising or jarring ("...blood all over the place...")
- Setup a system of recognizable patterns to allow for "compression"
- Be proactive about storing memories
