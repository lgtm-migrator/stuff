Steve Grand released on July 2, 2013 a song about desire for a same-sex partner.
What is striking about this song and about Steve is that he is the first
openly-gay Country/Western artist and this certainly the first gay-themed song
I've heard of. It's sweet and will have your heart thumping with joy.
