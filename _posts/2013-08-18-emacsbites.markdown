I've been having terrible issues with Vim (mostly incredibly slow launch times)
since I gave up my SSD and moved back to a 5400 RPM HDD. As such, I decided I
was sufficiently annoyed with Vim that my mind was open enough to learn a bit of
Emacs. This tutorial video is a great way to get started learning the very
basics of Emacs and Emacs Lisp.
