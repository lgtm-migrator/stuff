Diana Nyad is a hero of mine. An inspirational speaker and someone so
comfortable in her skin it's contagious, she is a marvel. She's a long-distance
swimmer to top all long-distance swimmers. In this video, she tells the story
and inspiration behind her swim from Cuba to Florida &mdash; a 53-hour journey
&mdash; and tells us to "never, ever give up."
