Watching this film (about 1 hour, 20 minutes) reminds me so much of
[Citizenfour](https://citizenfourfilm.com/). A conversation with some old
faces, and many new (to me) faces, "NOTHING TO HIDE" illustrates
beautifully the reasons against thinking you have nothing to hide from
surveillance.

The argument of social control really struck with me. I recently finished
reading "[Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)"
where much of the protagonists preoccupation with Big Brother and the Party
has to do with control over the populace. The United States's position that
mass surveillance helps find and stop terrorists doesn't hold muster when
you look at the incredible benefit a regime gets from a self-controlled
population. *Believing* that your Facebook messages, all your emails, all
your texts, and all your phone calls are collected and retrievable for
later makes you think twice about what you're sending. I think we should
all be more careful about what we record digitally, but worrying that every
action will be collected by the government is beyond reasonable.

"Nothing to Hide" paints an unsettling picture of how governments around
the world watch *everyone* – and we know they are, they have admitted to it
publicly in the 2013 "it's just metadata" response to Snowden – all the
time. The only ones who aren't caught in this web are the people they're
trying to catch. Meanwhile, our freedom to express ourselves is killed in
the crossfire.
