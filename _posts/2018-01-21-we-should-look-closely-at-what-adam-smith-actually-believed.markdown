What we all assume about Adam Smith's seminal contributions to economics
is wrong. _The Weath of Nations_ was a "very violent attack ... upon the
whole commercial system of Great Britain." That system was the mercantile
system. A handful of merchants controlled all business endeavors in Great
Britain in the late 18th century when Smith was writing. There was great
concentration of power in each sector, much like there is today. Sagar
writes in this piece for _Aeon_, "According to Smith, the most pressing
dangers came not from the state acting alone, but the state when captured
by merchant elites."

That passage about the "invisible hand" that we hear touted by
neoliberalists? Sagar writes, "in the passage of *The Wealth of Nations*
where he invoked the idea of the invisible hand, the immediate context was
not simply that of state intervention in general, but of state intervention
*undertaken at the behest of merchant elites* who were furthering their own
interests at the expense of the public." He continues:

How did Smith feel about regulation? He thought it was absolutely
necessary:

>  The true ‘science of a statesman or legislator’ consisted in deciding
>  how best to govern the merchants’ nefarious activities. Effective
>  politicians had to strike a balance between granting economic elites the
>  liberty to pursue legitimate commercial activities, while also applying
>  control when such activities became vehicles for exploitation.

Sagar shrewdly warns the reader to beg off any idea that Smith was
sympathetic to socialist or communist ideas. He was not. But, he was not a
Reagan/Thatcher neoliberal either. No preconceived plan -- no theories for
structuring economies, whether well-regulated or completely unregulated --
could work. Sagar clarifies:

> What Smith is saying is that in politics any preconceived plan –
> especially one that assumes that the millions of individuals composing a
> society will just automatically go along with it – is potentially
> dangerous. This is because the ‘spirit of system’ infects politicians
> with a messianic moral certainty that their reforms are so necessary and
> justified that almost any price is worth paying to achieve them.
> ... Thatcher’s violent restructuring of the British economy during the
> 1980s was as much a product of the ‘spirit of system’ as any piece of
> top-down Soviet industrial strategy.

In short, Smith believed that politicians must spend their time limiting
the exploitation of the masses by economic elites, and leave any notion of
knowing how best to structure the economy at home.
