An incredibly intriguing meditation on death and what we convince ourselves
about it. Rooted in a psychological principle called "*bias*", whereby we will
believe anything we are told that tells us that we are *not* going to die.

My favourite line:

> People who are made aware of their mortality are more willing to believe
> stories that tell them they can escape death and live forever.

This sounds quite like religion to me! :wink:
