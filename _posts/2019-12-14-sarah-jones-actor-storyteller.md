Sarah Jones is an actress & storyteller. Her TED biography describes her as a "polymorphic playwright." In [her 2015 TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_jones_one_woman_five_characters_and_a_sex_lesson_from_the_future), she acts out part of her play on the topic of sex work from the perspective of a future history professor teaching the topic to a group of students. In the story, the professor draws from a new-age technology which can record feelings and memories as well as words, and plays several of these recordings for the class. Each recording shares a different perspective on the topic of sex work, each with their own nuances. Jones's presentation is wildly entertaining, thought-provoking on the topic of sex work, and receives a standing ovation from the TED audience.

In [an earlier talk from TED 2009](https://www.ted.com/talks/sarah_jones_a_one_woman_global_village), Jones shared her brilliance again, this time creating characters who each would give their own TED talks. They are imaginative stories told by complex characters â€“ well worth a watch here as well.

Jones's performance style, using acting to bring a new character to life to tell a story, reminds me of [Anna Deavere Smith's TED 2005 talk "Four American Characters"](https://www.ted.com/talks/anna_deavere_smith_four_american_characters). I love this method of sharing perspectives and telling stories and hope to continue to see it on the TED stage.
