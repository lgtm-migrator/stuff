This post on the blog of Basecamp (née 37signals) tells a wonderful and
tragic and altogether human story of operating a modern web product. I can
tell you that this kind of introspection is always good, though there's a
little too much self-blame for my taste – these things happen and it's best
to learn from them and prevent them from happening again rather than
spending time feeling like you messed up. I especially liked this passage:

Follow-up work after an incident is absolutely crucial. It prevents these
same problems from recurring, but more importantly it gives the team the
confidence to continue innovating knowing that there is one less thing to
worry about.

Well done, and thanks for sharing your experience, Basecamp team!
