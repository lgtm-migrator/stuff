Jon Lovett is a pretty monumental political writer. Having first worked on
Hillary Clinton's campaign, he later joined President Barack Obama's
speech-writing staff and eventually ended up writing a political sitcom called
"1600 Penn" which flopped.

In this talk, he encourages the listeners to fight against "bullshit" - to avoid
bullshitting oneself and others. He calls upon the graduates to live lives of
honesty and sincerity. Living this way will be the only way to truly move
forward as a society and a people.
