John Gruber, author of Daring Fireball, really rips into the
privacy-destroying tracking companies' complaints about Apple's changes in
iOS 14. There's a bit more vitriol than I care for, but on the whole I
agree with Gruber's assessment: Apple's change here highlights the
downright creepy and inappropriate ways apps and websites track us as we go
about our daily lives.

I am eager to get my hands on iOS 14 for this feature alone â€“ stop tracking
me!
