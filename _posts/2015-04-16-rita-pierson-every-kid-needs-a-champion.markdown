Rita Pierson speaks at TED about teachers as champions of their students.
Teachers who believe teaching is about them presenting information and
their students simply consuming that information are given an alternative
perspective: teaching is an act of encouraging and being a source of
unwavering support for the students. Exhibiting humility and offering
encouragement and compassion is the best way to offer students the best
opportunity to learn.
