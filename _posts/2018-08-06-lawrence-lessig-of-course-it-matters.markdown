Larry Lessig is a hero of mine. I first heard of him when I started
following Aaron Swartz's activism and his online blog. They ignited my
interest in copyright norms, policies, and laws around the world. I
remember a summer where I spent hours researching Lessig's work, and
watched (probably) all of his talks. When I got to my last year in college,
I took a course a few courses that gave more fuel to the fire. In one, the
history of information systems, starting with the telegraph, was taught.
This gives one a foundational understanding of the context in which much of
digital copyright law was created. Another course was specifically
copyright and patent law in the digital age. We read seminal papers on
privacy, copyright, intellectual property, and studied a number of court
cases which analyzed and provided new jurisprudence in the field.

These days, Lessig is speaking out about the U.S.'s political system of
elections. Given the premise that the founders (esp. Hamilton) believed
elected officials should be responsive to the citizens, Lessig lays out a
proposition that today this is false. Our elected officials are instead
responsive to the _funders of campaigns_. These funders determine the
viability of a campaign: without their support, campaigns cannot receive
enough funding to get their messages out to the voters. Privately funded
elections as we currently conduct them are a recipe for a body of elected
officials whose job it is to ensure their campaign funders are happy,
rather than those citizens living in their districts.
