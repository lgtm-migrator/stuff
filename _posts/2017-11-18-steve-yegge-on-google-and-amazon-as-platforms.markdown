In 2011, Steve Yegge wrote a post (a rant, really) for Google's internal
message boards that he accidentally posted to his public Google+ account.
It's a prescient post, as we're still locked in epic platform wars with
Google lagging behind.

The one obvious benefit to the service-oriented architecture movement has
been an increased understanding in building a platform and exposing your
services to your users. Amazon has done this well, both with older product
suites like AWS, and with newer offerings like Alexa. Providing a clean
interface for users to super-charge & truly control your services is key to
Amazon's success.

Companies are increasingly understanding the importance of enabling an
ecosystem around their offerings by building out a platform. It's always a
pleasure to see a company release a new, rich API which allows developers --
and through their products, users -- to create something wonderful.
