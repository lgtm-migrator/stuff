I love this post by David Litwak, highlighting the forward-thinking nature of
this tech behemoth and all the good it is doing with its incredibly lucrative
AdWords service. This pretty much sums it up:

> Google is acting in the same spirit as Alexander Bell, using their incredibly
> lucrative money-maker (Google Adwords) to finance moonshots and ambitious side
> projects. Both GMail and Google Maps are great examples, and they are ahead of
> the game with a truly integrated travel search engine in Google Travel (2-3
> years in my estimate), Google Glass/wearable computing (at least 5 years
> before its time), autonomous cars (maybe 10 years) and household/military
> robotics (15 years?).

Litwak is right: Google (especially their Google X division) is pioneering the
future of tech, rarely allowing the worries of marketability or profitability to
hinder their advancements.
