I [first encountered Lex Fridman's podcast in July 2020 when it was still
called "Artificial Intelligence"]({% link _posts/2020-07-20-lex-fridman-podcast.markdown %}).
Since then, I have listened to quite a few episodes (though not all, since
they are often hours-long!) and have learned a lot from these discussions.
This is a place for me to capture my favorite episodes.
