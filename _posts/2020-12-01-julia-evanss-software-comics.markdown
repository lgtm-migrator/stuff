[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) is a software engineer and also a computing
educator! Her excellent comics can be found at [Wizard Zines](https://wizardzines.com).
I signed up for her bite-sized comics a while ago and they're wonderful!
You can sign up on the wizardzines.com/comics/ link above.
Here's one I received today:

![Julia Evans's comic explaining bash parameter expansion!](https://wizardzines.com/comics/parameter-expansion/parameter-expansion.png)

I'm constantly looking up how to do bash string manipulation and this comic
summarizes everything so concisely! This is kind of a cheat sheet and
entertaining comic all in one.

If you like these, definitely pick up some of the comics on
wizardzines.com. I have a few of them and found them both entertaining and
useful for my day-to-day work.
