In an [accompanying article for
Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-expert-twitter-only-goes-so-far-bring-back-blogs/),
author and computer scientist Cal Newport describes the present problem in
a COVID-19 world of distributing expert information. Essentially, in a
fast-evolving global crisis, access to quality information needs to be easy
and cheap. Twitter has helped surface the experts in these niche fields
who can provide the best information and research regarding COVID-19.

Twitter is notoriously low-signal-to-noise and low-fidelity. Scientific
journals, a very high-fidelity mechanism for sharing expert knowledge, have
been publishing COVID-19 research at break-neck pace. Most people won't and
can't have access to the knowledge in a scientific paper, however. So
what's in between Twitter and scientific journals?

Blogs!

Newport recommends leaning on existing institutions with high public trust
(e.g. Johns Hopkins University which has been publishing official data on
COVID-19 all along) and a strong technical foundation. (But we should avoid
politically-charged institutions like news outlets.)

I think this is a perfect idea, and many universities have a blogging
system already setup. During my days at Cornell, we had a WordPress
multisite setup that was linked to your NetID. Something like that could
easily be used to further the discourse here and provide more high-fidelity
information to the public.
