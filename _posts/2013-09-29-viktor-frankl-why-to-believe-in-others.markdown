On the TED website, it says:

> In this rare clip from 1972, legendary psychiatrist and Holocaust-survivor
> Viktor Frankl delivers a powerful message about the human search for meaning
> -- and the most important gift we can give others.

But here's the great meaning:

> If we seem to be idealist, and are over-estimating, overrating man, and
> looking at him that high - here, above - we promote him to what he really can
> be.

> [...]

> If you don't recognize a young man's will to meaning, man's search for
> meaning, you make him worse. You make him dull. You make him frustrated. You
> still add and contribute to his frustration. While, if you presuppose in this
> man, if in this so called criminal or juvenile delinquent or drug abuser and so forth there must be a
> spark of search for meaning. Let's recognize this, let's presuppose it, and
> then you will illicit it from him and you will make him become what he in
> principle is capable of becoming.
