Nadia's excellent talk discusses the woes of open source in the last few
years, with special notice given to the growth pains.

Open source has grown massively in popularity but the model has remained
the same: most projects have at most 1 or 2 maintainers handling
contributions, bug reports, and support requests. On top of that, we have
several orders of magnitude more projects. With a massive increase in
demand and a relatively minuscule increase in funding, open source
maintainers are burning out. How can we keep open source alive? I’m not
sure, but our current funding support needs to change. Folks maintaining
“for fun” on the weekend on projects which help companies make millions of
dollars won’t keep us afloat.
