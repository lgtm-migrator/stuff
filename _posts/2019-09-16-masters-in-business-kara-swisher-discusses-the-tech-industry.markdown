Kara Swisher has been a fixture of the technology world for as long as
personal computing journalism has existed. Kara’s thoughtful but bombastic
style has helped the world dig into some of the thorniest problems
presented by modern technology companies and products. Here, Kara is
interviewed by Barry Ritholz about her career in consumer technology
journalism and picks her brain on the issues of the day.

Much of “blunt” journalistic style can be in the shock-and-awe factor, but
Kara doesn’t fall for this gambit, at least in this conversation. She’s
straight-forward and is well-reasoned in her opinions, predictions, and
telling of history. I don’t usually read Kara’s work, but this conversation
makes me think I have really been missing a crucial voice in the industry.
