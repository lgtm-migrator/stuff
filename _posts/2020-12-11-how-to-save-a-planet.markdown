Climate change is the defining issue of our time. This podcast from Gimlet
Media discusses various topics within the climate change discussion and
offers education and concrete steps on moving forward. Dr. Ayana Elizabeth
Johnson co-hosts this podcast with Alex Bloomberg to great effect, bringing
an action-focused perspective to the broader narrative.

There are so many great episodes, but here are some of my favorites to get you started:

- [Trying to Talk to Family About Climate Change? Here's How](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/j4hk928/trying-to-talk-to-family-about-climate)
- [How Screwed Are We?](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/v4h3x95/how-screwed-are-we)
- [Breaking Buildings' Addiction to Fossil Fuels](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/mehklx8/breaking-buildings-addiction-to-fossil)
- [Cold Hard Cash for your Greenhouse Gas](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/kwhnz8b/cold-hard-cash-for-your-greenhouse-gas)
- [Are Electric Cars Really Better for the Climate?](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/94hblz9/are-electric-cars-really-better-for-the)
- [Making Republicans Environmentalists Again](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/gmhwdon/making-republicans-environmentalists)

A good place to start with any issue is to educate oneself. I think
listening to this podcast is a great first step.
